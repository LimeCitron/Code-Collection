To compare two Korean sentences using the Levenshtine Distance.

Korean Language can't be alphabet using only one Korean element.(e.g. ㄱ, ㅇ, ㅣ)

Composing two or three Korean elements, it can be make one Korean Alphabet. (e.g. 기, 옷, 람)

So, Levenshtein Distance for Korean should not be same as English version.

This code is not perfect, but try to compare similarity of Korean Sentence.
